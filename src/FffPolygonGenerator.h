 * Primary stage in Fused Filament Fabrication processing: Polygons are generated.
 * The model is sliced and each slice consists of polygons representing the outlines: the boundaries between inside and outside the object.
 * After slicing, the layers are processed; for example the wall insets are generated, and the areas which are to be filled with support and infill, which are all represented by polygons.
 * In this stage nothing other than areas and circular paths are generated, which are both represented by polygons.
 * No infill lines or support pattern etc. is generated.
