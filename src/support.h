        2) Then it goes down (y+1) a row, and finds the proper point to start the next line (starting at startPoint.x going to the right till it sees a point where it needs support again)
        3) If this is beyond the final point of step 1 then it generates the final polygon and stops.
            If it's within the range of step 1 then it goes to step 1 again to add this line as well. This loops till it can no longer add a line.

        And as a final step it uses the offset function to union all the generated support polygons together and apply the XY offset which grows the support material a bit.
        
        Note that this does not cut the object from the support material. The fffProcessor will apply the XY offset to the outline of the print and substract that from the given support polygons.
