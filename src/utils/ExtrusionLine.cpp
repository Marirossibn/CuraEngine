     computing the area in a 'fan' where each of the blades of the fan go from
     the origin to one of the segments. While removing vertices the area in
     this fan accumulates. By subtracting the area of the blade connected to
     the short-cutting segment we obtain the total area of the cutoff region.
     From this area we compute the height of the representative triangle using
     the standard formula for a triangle area: A = .5*b*h
